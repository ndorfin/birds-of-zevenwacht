<h3>A little history</h3>
<p>
	Upon returning to Cape Town after many years in New Zealand, I was struck with just how prolific the birdlife is here in Zevenwacht (and the Western Cape). Being a budding photographer, I saw an opportunity to start a new project of sorts…
</p>
<p>
	First, I roped my mother, Ingunn, into recording all the sightings we could of the individual species around here. Any birder will understand the infectious nature of trying to record as many species as possible.<br>
	Second, I wanted to capture as many of the birds as I could with my camera.
</p>
<h4>The push online</h4>
<p>
	When friends and family asked for my bird photos, I'd share them using Apple's Photo iCloud link. While it served its purpose well, I felt like there was missed opportunity to both document the birds themselves, but also the photos and their associated sightings. So I set about building this site.
</p>
<h4>The first contributions</h4>
<p>
	Tony, who lives in the same gated community as us, is also a keen birder and photographer. When I told him about this project, and asked if he was keen to contribute, he gladly showed up a few days later with a portable drive of his chosen photographs.

	My stepdad – Mike – has also sent me a number of bird photographs, some dating back to the time when he and my mom moved into the neighbourhood.
