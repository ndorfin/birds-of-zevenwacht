  We often walk past the giant blue skip or dumpster on the return leg of our walks, and there are always Sacred Ibis rummaging through this skip.\
  [Funny storyâ€¦ in Australia, they call Sacred Ibises 'Bin Chickens', I can see why.]\
  We disturbed the flock, and they took off and landed in the nearby dam to the South.
