description: |-
  The Sparrowhawks had apparently been nesting in the Stone Pines on the Village's south-eastern boundary, so we went to investigate.
  As we approached the trees, one of the Sparrowhawks took flight, followed by another shortly afterwards.
  We couldn't see a nest, but there was evidence of predation, and many predator droppings on the ground below the Stone Pines.
