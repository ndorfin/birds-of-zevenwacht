<h3>
	A little history
</h3>
<p>
	Upon returning to Cape Town after many years in New Zealand, I was struck with just how prolific the birdlife is here in the Western Cape.
	Being a budding photographer, I saw an opportunity to start a new project of sorts…
</p>
<p>
	First, I roped my mother, <a href="{{ url('person_detail', 6) }}">Ingunn</a>, into recording all the sightings we could of the individual species around here.
	Any birder will understand the infectious nature of trying to record as many species as possible.<br>
	Second, I wanted to capture as many of the birds as I could with my camera.
</p>

<h4>
	The push online
</h4>
<p>
	When friends and family asked for my bird photos, I'd share them using Apple's Photo iCloud link.
	While it served its purpose well, I felt like there was missed opportunity to both document the birds themselves, but also the photos and their associated sightings.
	So I set about building this site.
</p>

<h4>
	The first contributions
</h4>
<p>
	<a href="{{ url('person_detail', 3) }}">Tony</a>, who lives in the same gated community as us, is also a keen birder and photographer.
	When I told him about this project, and asked if he was keen to contribute, he gladly showed up a few days later with a portable drive of his chosen photographs.
</p>
<p>
	My stepdad – <a href="{{ url('person_detail', 4) }}">Mike</a> – has also sent me a number of bird photographs, some dating back to the time when he and my mom moved into the neighbourhood.
